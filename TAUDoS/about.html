			<h2>About</h2>
			 
			<p>TAUDoS is a four year project (2021-2025) funded by 
			the<a href="https://anr.fr/"> Agence Nationale de la 
			Recherche</a> (French NSF).</p>  <p>Recent successes of 
			Machine Learning (ML), in particular the deep learning 
			approach, and their growing impact on numerous fields have 
			raised questions about the induced decision process. 
			Indeed, the most efficient models are often overly 
			parameterized black boxes whose inner ruling system is not 
			accessible to human comprehension.</p>  <p>For scientific, 
			industrial, commercial, and even legal reasons, it is then 
			crucial for the future of the field to provide a better 
			understanding of the mechanisms that allow these amazing 
			achievements. This is the ambition of our project that will 
			be achieved by providing elements that allow a better 
			scientific comprehension of the models, strengthening our 
			experimental results by theoretical guarantees, 
			incorporating components dedicated to interpretability 
			within the models, and allowing trustful quantitative 
			comparison between learned models.</p>  <p>The originality 
			and the specificities of TAUDoS are due to three major 
			characteristics: The focus on models for sequential data, 
			such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), while most works 
			concentrate on feed-forward networks; The will to analyse 
			these models in the light of formal language theory; The 
			goal to target both rigorous theoretical analyses and 
			empirical evidence related to interpretability.</p>  
			<p>More precisely, TAUDoS follows 4 interconnected 
			scientific objectives. The first one is to provide 
			theoretical studies both to characterize classes of 
			learnable RNN in connection with formal languages classes 
			and to design provable learning algorithms for them. The 
			second one is to propose new knowledge distillation 
			algorithms to extract simpler, more understandable models 
			from deep RNN, either from the whole model or by 
			identifying interesting subparts. The third idea is to 
			design new learning strategies to favor interpretability of 
			RNN in the training stage, either by incorporating 
			structural elements in the architecture or by including in 
			the objective function to be optimized additional terms 
			dedicated to interpretability. Finally, the project aims at 
			initiating the research path of learning metrics to compare 
			RNN on a given task, in order to better understand and mine 
			the topical zoo of RNN architectures.</p>  <p>While the 
			core of the project is to bring better understanding of 
			deep learning, TAUDoS will hopefully also enjoy potentially 
			great side-effects : new initialisation procedures and new 
			learning algorithms for RNN, models of equivalent quality 
			to huge deep ones that require far less computation power, 
			new interesting classes of formal languages to study in 
			order to understand the capacities of RNN, new strategies 
			for favouring interpretability, new metrics between models 
			that can be clues for the transferability of 
			interpretability, ...</p>  <p>In addition to the undeniable 
			scientific impacts that the advancements of TAUDoS will 
			have, the presence in the consortium of a R&amp;D firm 
			ensures its valorization. Indeed, in addition to usual 
			scientific benchmarking, our approaches will be tested on 
			two types of data linked to on-going projects of the firm: 
			medical ones to bring understanding to a prognostic tool, 
			and ones for lawbots.</p>  <p>Furthermore, TAUDoS comes 
			within the scope of the open science movement: new 
			benchmarks to help answer the hard question of the 
			evaluation of interpretability will be freely available, 
			and a user-friendly open source toolbox containing our 
			algorithms will be developed.</p>  <p>The consortium 
			gathers 2 French academic teams, a French firm (PME), is 
			enforced by the presence of one of the best research labs 
			on ML, and includes internationally renowned and 
			complementary experts covering a wide spectrum of the 
			field.</p>
